`TeX-e-Parsi` is a Persian and English typesetting system based on Donald Knuth's TeX Program, developed by the Dade-Kavi-Iran company during the 1990s. The very first version was released in 1991, and then in 1994-5, the next version was released based on the `TeX pre-3.0` and `LaTeX 2.09`. This bundle worked under `MS-DOS`.

In that era, some publishers in Iran, like Fatemi, and Nashr-e-Daneshgahi, used it for making high-quality scientific documents. Unfortunately, this was not free and its usage has been restricted. Finally, in 2007, [SCICT](https://web.archive.org/web/20140712020048/http://www.scict.ir/portal/Home/Default.aspx?CategoryID=387eee4e-1cf4-48c7-a23e-034f9f840e3f) bought it and it has been released as free software since then.

This repository includes `TeX-e-Parsi` bundle and several manuals describing its usage.
